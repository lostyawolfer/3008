# SCP-3008 in minecraft - experience the cubical infinite ikea
everything including some gameplay features and soundtrack stolen from **uglyburger0** who created a roblox game called "3008". please check out his work if you haven't, but im sure you already know who im talking about

## there is going to be an "official" server! soonâ„¢
but, for now, you can download this repo as a datapack and put it into your world (ONLY NEW WORLDS!!!) and then when you load in do a "/function 3008:generation/final_generate". this will generate a 800x800 block world and spawn you into it immediately after generating it. **DON'T FORGET TO GET THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR IT BEFORE STARTING!!!** the resourcepack is available in "resources" branch of this repository


## works on servers!
don't hesitate to invite your friends to play together while waiting for an official server.
