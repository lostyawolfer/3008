# SCP-3008 in minecraft - experience the cubical infinite ikea
everything including some gameplay features and soundtrack stolen from **uglyburger0** who created a roblox game called "3008". please check out his work if you haven't, but im sure you already know who im talking about<br>
what do i mean stolen gameplay features?<br>
well, \[spoiler\], foggy day, blood night, weekdays with food replenishing every tuesday, 100 health instead of minecraft's normal 20, low health effects, etc.<br>
however there are some little additions you may find interesting!

## there is going to be an "official" server! soonâ„¢
but, for now, you can download this repo as a datapack and put it into your world (ONLY NEW WORLDS!!!) and then when you load in do a "/function 3008:generation/final_generate". this will generate a 800x800 block world and spawn you into it immediately after generating it. **DON'T FORGET TO GET THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR IT BEFORE STARTING!!!** the resourcepack is available in "resources" branch of this repository.

## works on servers!
don't hesitate to invite your friends to play together while waiting for an official server!<br>
**DO NOT GENERATE WORLDS IN SERVER ENVIRONMENTS**. generation makes a shit ton of compute-heavy things (which are compute-heavy because of how minecraft is built), which makes ticks during generation longer, which usually makes servers' performance checker go nuts and crash it all the time. TO AVOID THIS, **GENERATE A SINGLEPLAYER WORLD**, AND THEN **COPY THE GENERATED WORLD** TO THE SERVER.
